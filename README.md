updated AWS Lambda python code for Python 3.10

I just modified the AWS Lambda python 2.70 code from the resources tab to work with 3.10 if you did want to work along with the video demo. The exisiting code will error if tested/used.  At some point I expect this will be updated as mentioned in the video.
